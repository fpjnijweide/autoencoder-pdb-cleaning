Several options are added, such as convolutional layers, Gaussian kernels, and the ability to use a variational autoencoder. Methods were written so that a queue of experiments can be made, while the amount of outputs is heavily reduced.\n","\n"," After running the experiments, the data was copied into a text editor, and using regular expressions, lines that do not contain curly brackets (such lines only contain information which is useful to see training progress) were removed. This data can be pasted into a program such as Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel, and split into multiple columns (like in a .csv file) using the semicolon as delimiter. The result of this can be seen in the .xlsx file included in this folder.\n","\n"," For detailed explanations on the code, please look at continuous_variable_training.ipynb\n","\n"," PS. these experiments will take several days to run on modern desktop computers.
